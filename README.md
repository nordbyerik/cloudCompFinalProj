# cloudCompFinalProj
Files in this repository and what they do:

	1.) The folder guiProj- Contains the files used to create the GUI. These include but are not limited to
	    the pom.xml file and Frame1.java. File Frame1.java is the main file for the application. It contains
	    the code use to create the gui. This GUI does not contain any of the extra credit functionality 
	    (ie word counters, Top N Search etc). The main way that I communicate with Google cloud is through
	    the Java API I built this in Eclipse and exported it to a runnable jar.

	2.) runnableJar.jar- The jar mentioned above 

	3.) Dockerfile- The Dockerfile

	4.) WordCount.java- This is the inverted index java file. It was originally going to be wordcount but I
	    but I ran out of time. It is currently still named WordCount because I am too afraid
	    to change anything in this project (considering it is worth 30% of our grade).

	5.) scriptToRun- The script I used to make it easier on myself to


Improvements I would make (for the sake of transparency):

	1.) I coded the merge myself and output it straight to the CLI. The reasoning behind this was
	    that the GUI was too small and probably would have been challenging to navigate given
	    the huge size of the files created. I think that I could have found a more effective 
	    way to display this information.


Overall, I am pretty satisfied with how the project turned out. It satisfies nearly all of the requirements
and it was my first time ever using Maven.
